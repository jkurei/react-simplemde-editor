I need to make some changes to benrlodge's [wrapper](https://github.com/benrlodge/react-simplemde-editor) on [SimleMDE](https://github.com/NextStepWebs/simplemde-markdown-editor). I'll contribute what seems useful as soon as it's stable and tested. 

For know, if you've stumbled upon this repo before his, I recommend you just go to [the original project](https://github.com/benrlodge/react-simplemde-editor).

All credit belongs to NextStepWebs and benrlodge.
